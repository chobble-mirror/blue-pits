## **Lynn Collins**

Hi, I'm Lynn, the CEO of Blue Pits Housing Action. I'd like to introduce our Board of Directors also known as Charitable Trustees.

Our Trustees provide strategic leadership and have overall control of Blue Pits Housing Action. Our Trustees are responsible for making sure the charity is doing what it was set up to do. In our case;

1. To carry on for the benefit of the community the business of providing social housing and any associated amenities, services, advice or assistance for persons: o in necessitous circumstances upon terms appropriate to their means; o for whom it would be charitable to provide housing

2. To promote or carry out any other charitable purpose that can be carried out by a company registered as a social landlord with the tenant services authority or such similar authority from time to time.

**Meet our Trustees:**

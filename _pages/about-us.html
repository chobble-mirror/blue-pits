<p>Blue Pits Housing Action provides support to all adult groups, including those with mental health needs and those with a dual diagnosis of learning disability or substance misuse. </p>
<p>We provide a highly-skilled, diverse and experienced workforce and involve users of the service and any appropriate family members or carers, consulting with them to agree on an individual, needs-led holistic support plans and risk assessments.
People are provided with opportunities to learn and develop skills through educational and awareness workshops, while our devoted staff facilitate their development and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We promote multi-disciplinary assistance by working with primary, secondary and tertiary health and social care providers.
We're proud of the progress made by every single tenant at Blue Pits Housing Action - care and compassion from our skilled and knowledgeable staff support people as they gain their independence and learn important life skills. We strive to surpass the care provided by other mental health and learning disability support agencies and this is reflected on the levels of satisfaction felt by our tenants.</p>

Complaints about social housing services are managed following the [Housing Ombudsman's Complaints Handling Code](https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/landlords-info/complaint-handling-code/)

Blue Pits Housing Action (BPHA) aims to deliver a positive tenant experience by providing high quality supported housing and creating communities that are safe and secure and where our tenants are happy to live.

To achieve this, we will:

- View complaints positively
- Treat all our tenants fairly
- Apologise when things go wrong
- Take prompt action to investigate and then put things right.
- Learn from the mistakes we make
- Commit to making improvements.
